## 1 Python classes:

1. Definition: a custmisable data type in python. See the linke below:
https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp  
  
2. Example code: 
    1. to define a class:
    ```python
    class Flight():
        # Method to create new flight with given capacity
        def __init__(self, capacity):
            self.capacity = capacity
            self.passengers = []

        # Method to add a passenger to the flight:
        def add_passenger(self, name):
            if not self.open_seats():
                return False
            self.passengers.append(name)
            return True

        # Method to return number of open seats
        def open_seats(self):
            return self.capacity - len(self.passengers)
    ```
    2. to use the class:
    ```python
    # Create a new flight with o=up to 3 passengers
    flight = Flight(3)

    # Create a list of people
    people = ["Harry", "Ron", "Hermione", "Ginny"]

    # Attempt to add each person in the list to a flight
    for person in people:
        if flight.add_passenger(person):
            print(f"Added {person} to flight successfully")
        else:
            print(f"No available seats for {person}")

    """ Output:
    Added Harry to flight successfully
    Added Ron to flight successfully
    Added Hermione to flight successfully
    No available seats for Ginny
    """
    ```

## 2 Functional Programming: Decorators
You can modified a function in python. Which is an unique feature of python.
code:
```python
def announce(f):
    def wrapper():
        print("About to run the function")
        f()
        print("Done with the function")
    return wrapper

@announce
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

hello()

""" Output:
About to run the function
Hello, world!
Done with the function
"""
```

## 3 lambda function
when you need a one-line function:
```python
people = [
    {"name": "Harry", "house": "Gryffindor"},
    {"name": "Cho", "house": "Ravenclaw"},
    {"name": "Draco", "house": "Slytherin"}
]

def f(person):
    return person["name"]

people.sort(key=f)

print(people)

""" Output:
[{'name': 'Cho', 'house': 'Ravenclaw'}, {'name': 'Draco', 'house': 'Slytherin'}, {'name': 'Harry', 'house': 'Gryffindor'}]
"""
```
this code also shows how to sort a list with dict inside.
