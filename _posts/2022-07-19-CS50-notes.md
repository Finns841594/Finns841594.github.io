Having CS50 course now! Taking some notes here about my struggling things on coding.

0.  The first home work is making a small game with visualized program platform from MIT, below is my work:  
    <https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/712728725>

1. In programing homework "substitution":
    - Its important to remeber that a string is an array of chars:
    The following 2 lines:
    ```c
    string text = "Hi!";
    printf("%i", text[0])
    ```
    will return the acsii code of H. While the following one line:
    ```c
    - printf("%c", text[0])
    ```
    will print out the letter H.

2. When testting a program, I might need to type in several inputs repeatly. Here is the simple way to do it 'automatically':
    - Create a txt file, named it as 'test.txt'.
    - Typed in the input, one line one input, save it.
    - When run a program, do it like this:
    - ./program_name another_input_if_needed < test.txt
    - then the program will take the input from text.txt when it prompts for the input.

3. Use the following code at the outside of main() to create a gloable const variable:
    ```c
    const int HEADER_SIZE = 44;
    ```

4. Suprised by that fopen("fileaddress","open_method") function: If the file do not exist at the address, this function will create one; If the file arealdy exits, it erase the content of the file.

5. Use sizeof(int16_t) to get the length of the type of data, in %lu, which is unsigned long, here the answer is 2 (bytes);
    - sizeof(char)   returns 1;
    - sizeof(int)    returns 4;
    - sizeof(float)  returns 4;
    - sizeof(double) returns 8;

6. It is easy to under stand the pointer by writing a program that swap two values: 
    ```C
    int main(void)
    {
    int a = get_int("A: ");
    int b = get_int("B: ");
    printf("A is %i, B is %i\n", a, b);

    swap(&a, &b);
    printf("After swap\nA is %i, B is %i\n", a, b);
    }

    void swap(int *x, int *y)
    {
    int z = *x; // Store the value of point x to the variable z
    *x = *y; // write the value of point b to the point position x addressed
    *y = z; // write the value of variable z to the point position y addressed
    }
    "
    &a will get the address of variable a, it is a pointer:
    'int *z = &a;'
    if we print the z, we get a string which represents an address:
    "printf('z: %p\n', z);"
    "0x1234567"
    if we print the *z, we get the value at the address z:
    "printf('z: %i\n', *z);"
    "50"
    ```

7. fopen(), fread(),fseek(),

8. about the point, check the code below to understand what & and * being used.
    ```C
    int main(void)
    {
    int a = 101;
    int *b = &a;

    printf("1: %i\n", a);
    printf("2: %p\n", &b);
    printf("3: %p\n", b);
    printf("4: %i\n", *b);
    }
    ```
    
9. Most of the time bug happens with passing wrong type of data into a function, so it is super important to know that type of data you are passing!

10. Double quote " " is different from single quote ' ' in C; " " is for strings, for example "A string is written here", while as 'A' is equavalent to A's ascii code 65.

11. Several ways to build a dict quickly in Python:

    ```python
    a = dict(one=1, two=2, three=3)
    b = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}
    c = dict(zip(['one', 'two', 'three'], [1, 2, 3])) # This one is so cool  
    d = dict([('two', 2), ('one', 1), ('three', 3)])
    e = dict({'three': 3, 'one': 1, 'two': 2})
    a == b == c == d == e
    ```

12. For the easier programing, its better to comment on the variable that created, what type of data it is, and what structure it has. This makes things much easier!  

13. In SQL, ORDER BY can have several statements. The First has the highest priority, for example:  
    ```sql
    SELECT movies.title, ratings.rating FROM movies JOIN ratings ON movies.id = ratings.movie_id WHERE movies.year = 2010 ORDER BY ratings.rating DESC, movies.title ASC;  
    ```
    The command above will order the result first by the rating, then if two movies have the same rating, the one with title name alphabetical priority will be the ordered forward the other one.

14. In html for using margin setting by passing different amount of parameters:
    1. margin: up right down left;
    2. margin: up right&left down;
    3. margin: up&down right&left;
    4. margin: all-sides;
